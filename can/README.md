# Web Serial

Web serial is a simple online terminal that uses the
[Web Serial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API)
meaning that it can be use on any browser that supports web serial.

## Wish List

- Means to add extensions to serial terminal.
    - Examples:
        - Read compressed messages and make them human readable
        - Convert stacktrace addresses into human readable names
        - Parse output for sensor readings and graph them
    - Should be easy to install from a user's point of view, maybe even 
      uploadable.
